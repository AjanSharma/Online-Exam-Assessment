Our learning platform has been implemented using three assessment strategies: - MCQ’s, Programming assessments
and Rubrics.
MCQ was implemented as a basic building strategy, in order to design the initial version of our learning platform.
This strategy contains multiple options for a given problem, out of which only 1 answer is correct. This assessment
strategy was preferred by many students as guessing works sometimes pays you deed. This very reason was the
downfall of this strategy as it eliminates the overall programming skill analysis of the students. To counter these
negatives, Programming assessments came into the picture.
Programming assessment was introduced in order to analyze the strengths and weaknesses in the field of computer
programming. This strategy was subjective based as a student needs to brainstorm in order to find the correct
answer. Guessing strategy is significantly minimized or curbed in this type of assessment strategy. This strategy
works on the principle of partial results, i.e. if there are multiple answers to a definite question and the student is
only able to attempt only a part of it correctly, then he would be given marks for the portion of the answer he
attempted correctly. With the help of our Programming based assessment candidates can be evaluated in the specific
field of the concept.
Rubrics strategy came into limelight as it clubs all the positives of both the assessment strategies. This assessment is
MCQ based with one question having a single or multiple correct answers. This also empowers the usage of partial
results. Radio buttons are used if the given question has only a single correct answer, whereas checkboxes enable
students to mark multiple options, if the question demands multiple correct answers.
